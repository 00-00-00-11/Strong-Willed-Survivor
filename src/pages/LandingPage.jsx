					<h2 className="m-4">HISTORY OF STRONG WILLED SURVIVOR </h2>
					<p className="m-4">
						It began with an IDEA...COMPASSION...and LOVE by then twelve-year
						old Michael Giles, who in 2014 searched for resources in the Hampton
						Roads area of Virginia, to aid him in sorting out his feelings
						concerning his mother’s cancer diagnosis. He was unsuccessful in
						finding the resources he desperately needed and felt this was
						unacceptable. So, he created the first SWS Kids FUN DAY, as a way to
						provide an outlet for not only himself, but other kids and teens
						experiencing similar issues.
					</p>
					<p className="m-4">
						After combining Kids FUN Day with some EDUCATION and AWARENESS, the
						first celebration of LIFE was hosted in September 2015. Which lead
						to the creation of Strong Willed Survivor, an organization founded
						by both mother and son with the mission of providing awareness;
						while uplifting and encouraging all through times of adversity. They
						believe that no matter what obstacles a person may face if you keep
						pushing and stayed encouraged; through FAITH, HOPE, LOVE and SUPPORT
						you can find light at the end of the tunnel (even if it’s only a
						glimpse).
					</p>
					<p className="m-4">
						Through the “Family-Focused” workshops, activities, and programs,
						Strong Willed Survivor has been able to reach beyond the Hampton
						Roads area of Virginia and aid children, teens, survivors,
						caregivers of all ages and Angel Families.
